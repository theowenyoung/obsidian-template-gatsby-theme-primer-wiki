[[#Third party sync|More about this later]].\n\nTo start syncing, first you need to create a remote vault that stores your encrypted data.\n\nTo do that, go to Setting => Sync => Pick remote vault => Choose => Create new vault.\n\nAfter creating it, you can immediately connect to the vault by clicking on the \"Connect\" button next to it.\n\nYou can choose to either start syncing immediately after connecting, or choose folders to ignore.\n\n##### Set encryption password \n\nBy default, you need to set an encryption password for your vault. This password is used to encrypt and decrypt your data and is extremely important.\n\nYou'll be asked for the password any time you setup sync with an encrypted vault. ==If you forget or lose the password, your data will remain encrypted and unusable forever.

You can hover over the status icon to read more about what's going on.\n\nClicking on the status icon will open up sync settings as a shortcut.\n\n### Version history\n\nAs you edit your notes, versions are saved approximately every 10 seconds. ==Version history is only available for notes, not attachments.==\n\nYou can right click a file in the file explorer pane to see its version history. This option is also available in the more options menu.\n\nAfter selecting a version in the left column in the version history screen, you can restore the file to this version by clicking on the \"Restore\" button.\n\n### Deleted files\n\nAfter you delete a file, you can view it in Setting => Sync => Deleted files => View.\n\nClicking on a deleted file will open its version history.

You can take advantage of this to create different profiles in your remote vault to sync your settings. A common use case, for example, is to use a different profile for mobile devices vs desktop devices.\n\n#### Settings version history\n\nIf something goes wrong, and you lost some of your settings, you can always revert the affected settings file through the \"Settings version history\" section in Sync.\n\n### Third party sync\n\nIf you are using Obsidian Sync, we do not recommend using third party sync services like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud to sync the same vault between the same devices using Obsidian Sync. Doing so may cause conflicts, duplicate files, or in the worst case, could lead to corrupted files.\n\nIf you do setup Obsidian Sync and a third party sync service to sync a vault between two devices, then the following will happen:\n- If Obsidian Sync \"wins\" the race and syncs your file first, then your third party sync service will generate a \"conflicted copy\".\n- If your third party sync service \"wins\" the race and syncs your file first, then Obsidian Sync will attempt to merge the two slightly different versions, often causing the last few characters you just typed to be rolled back.\n\nIf you wish to maintain a backup of your vault using a third party sync service, you can still do so by setting up your sync provider on your primary single device, but not on your secondary devices. This will ensure that your third party sync service does not \"race\" with Obsidian Sync.\n\n### FAQ\n\n##### What is end-to-end encryption?\n\nEnd-to-end encryption means the data is encrypted from the moment it leaves your device, and can only be decrypted using your encryption key once it's back on one of your devices.\n\nWe do not have the capability of reading your data, nor do any potential eavesdroppers, such as your internet service provider.\n\nIn the rare case of a complete server breach, your data will remain encrypted, and nobody will have the ability to decrypt your files without knowing your password.\n\n##### How many remote vaults can I have?\n\nEach account with Obsidian Sync can have up to 5 remote vaults.\n\n##### How long is version history kept?\n\nVersion histories are kept for up to one year before we clean it up.\n\n##### How large can each remote vault be?\n\nAt the moment, each remote vault can have up to 4 GB of data, including version history.\n\n##### Is my data encrypted on my hard disk?\n\nNo, your data is still in plain text on your hard disk. If you wish to encrypt it from people who use your computer, you should look for a disk encryption solution.\n\n##### How long is my data kept after my subscription expires?\n\nData in your remote vaults, including version history, is kept for one month for you, after your subscription expires.\n\nAs long as you renew within one month, there should be no impact on your usage.\n\n##### Can I use Obsidian Sync as a backup solution?\n\nObsidian Sync is designed as a data synchronization service, rather than a backup service.\n\nWith version history, it does provide some backup features, however we still recommend having additional backup measures.\n\nObsidian Sync is currently in beta testing, so we strongly recommend having backups, in case of software bugs and glitches.\n\n##### Should I pick my own encryption password?\n\nPick your password if you require the highest level of security and privacy. This guarantees that anyone who doesn't know your password will never be able to read your notes.\n\nLetting us manage your encryption key is more convenient, and you do not risk forgetting or losing your password.\n\nYour local vault is not affected by this option. If you properly backup your local vault, this may not be a problem for you.\n\n##### Is the end-to-end encryption strong?\n\nWe use industry-standard AES-256 to encrypt your data. AES-256 is a military-grade encryption specification that is widely used in online banking.\n\nHere are the technical details for those interested:\n\n- Key derivation function used: scrypt with salt\n- Encryption algorithm used: AES-256 using GCM\n\n##### What does the `vault limit exceeded` error mean?\n\nEach vault using Obsidian Sync has a maximum size of 4gb. This error indicates your vault has exceeded that limit in size. Don't forget: attachments and version history contributes to the maximum, so you may exceed your 4gb limit even if your vault's actual size is less than 4gb. \n\nIf you see this error, Obsidian can help you identify and purge large files from the Vault. Go to the Obsidian Sync settings in Preferences => Sync and look for the \"Vault size over limit\" options. \n","excerpt":"Obsidian Sync™ is a paid service to sync notes between vaults on various devices.

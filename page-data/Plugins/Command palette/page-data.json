This lets you choose them without typing anything. It's a good place to put your most frequently used commands.\n\nPinned commands are managed on the Command palette options screen under Plugin Options.

The arrow keys will move up and down the list, and `Return` will activate the command. \n\n- Search in the command palette is fuzzy, so you can type part of the word to get matches.

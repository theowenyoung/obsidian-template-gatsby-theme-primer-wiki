If you do not include this variable, the content will automatically be placed at the bottom of the template.\n- `{{fromTitle}}`: the name of the note where the new note comes from.\n- `{{newTitle}}`: the title of the new file.

For example, you can do `{{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}` and it will resolve to the date or time when the note gets created.\n\n### Confirm file merge\n\nMerging files will delete the file and is destructive, so by default we ask for your confirmation. If you prefer, you can choose to skip this confirmation.\n\nIn case you accidentally merged something and want to get it back, consider using the [[File recovery]] plugin to recover it.","excerpt":"The Note composer plugin allows you to easily merge two note or extract part of a note into its own note.

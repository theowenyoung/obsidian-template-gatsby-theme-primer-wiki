No vendor lock-in. The less vendor features you use, the better you'll be able to migrate, including this theme. So we should only write standard markdown. I like `[[WikiLink]]`, but I love standard markdown more. So we should always use standard markdown link `[text](https://example.com)`, or use [Wikilink](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/wikilinks) with [Link Reference Definitions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/features/link-reference-definitions), and don't use any vendor locked-in feature. That give us the capability change our theme, or hosted place.\n\n2. Use meta data instead of special characters. We should use `tags` as the document's metadata, not `#tag` in the plain text.\n\n3. Use tags instead of categories. Minimal subfolders.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### New Wiki\n\n1. Press \"Use this template\" button at [obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki](https://github.com/theowenyoung/obsidian-template-gatsby-theme-primer-wiki/generate) (that's this repository!) to fork it to your own GitHub account.

Financial contribution\n\n#### Commercial license\n\nIf you'd like to use Obsidian for work activities, try to let your work get you a [[Commercial license|commercial license]].\n\n#### Add-on services\n\nIf you'd like to make a website from your notes, consider getting [[Obsidian Publish]] if the price works for you.\n\nIf you're interested in an end-to-end encryption syncing solution, we also offer [[Obsidian Sync]]. In addition to end-to-end encryption, Obsidian Sync also comes with version history.\n\n#### Catalyst\n\nIf you don't need any of the above, you can get a [[Catalyst license]] to support our developer, which also gives you access to [[Insider builds]].\n\n#### Obsidian Unlimited\n\nFor those very passionate about the project, there's also the Obsidian Unlimited option, which lets you pay as much as you want to support development and help us stay independent. We recommend going for this option after you've purchased the VIP tier of [[Catalyst license]] so that you can enjoy the benefits.\n\n### 2. Extending Obsidian\n\n#### CSS themes\n\nIf you're proficient in CSS, another way is to contribute a theme, so that people who don't know CSS can enjoy your work. If you decide to do so, feel free to share it on the #css-themes channel on Discord, or in the Share & Showcase category on our forum.\n\nIf you'd like to add your theme to the community theme list, let us know! (Or we might reach out to you first!)\n\n#### Plugins\n\nIf you're a JavaScript/TypeScript programmer, you can write [[Third-party plugins]] for Obsidian, now that our plugin API is in alpha.\n\n### 3. Translation and proofreading\n\n#### Translating the interface\n\nIf you know another language (preferably natively), you can help with translating the Obsidian interface into your language. You can do that by submitting a pull request in [our translation GitHub repository](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-translations) to get it into the next version of the app.\n\n#### Translating the docs\n\nWe're in the middle of reorganizing and stabilizing the documentation you're reading right now. Once it's in a good shape, you can also help translate it, so that people who don't know English can also easily learn to use Obsidian.\n\n#### Found a typo?\n\nIf you found a typo or a grammar mistake in these documentation, feel free to submit a pull request in [our documentation repository](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-docs).\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Advanced topics/Customizing CSS/","title":"Customizing CSS"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"If you are building or modifying your own css, you can open the developer tools by using `Ctrl+Shift+I` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Opt+I` on macOS to get information on the elements you want to customize. \n\nChanges to themes and snippets will be detected automatically and reapplied.

This can be useful if you want the ability to recover your Vault files separate from your system trash. \n- You can also set obsidian to just delete files without possibility of recovery. \n\nThese options can be found in Settings => Files & Links."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Advanced topics/Drag and Drop/","title":"Drag and Drop"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"There are many ways to drag and drop things around Obsidian to make the experience smoother:\n\n### Drag panes\n\nSee [[Working with multiple notes#5 Panes can be rearranged by dragging|dragging panes]]\n\n### Drag sources\n\n- You can drag a file, or multiple files from the [[file explorer]].\n- You can drag a file from a [[search]] result.\n- You can drag a file from [[backlinks]] or unlinked references.\n- You can drag a file from the [[starred notes]].\n- You can drag a file from a link inside the note, in preview mode.\n\n### Drop destinations\n\n- You can drop a file on a pane header to open the file there. Hold `Alt` (or `Shift` on MacOS) to drop anywhere on the pane.\n- You can drop a file on a folder in the [[file explorer]] to move the file there.\n- You can drop a file into an editor to insert it as a link. The generated link also follows your preferences, such as relative paths, or using markdown links.\n- You can drop a file on the [[starred notes]] to star it.\n\n### Dragging from outside Obsidian\n\n- You can drag any HTML content from the browser into Obsidian to automatically convert them into Markdown\n- You can drag and drop any files from your native file explorer to have Obsidian import (make a copy of) those files in your vault's attachment folder and insert them as internal links. Hold `Ctrl` to create `file:///` absolute links to those files instead of importing a copy.\n\n### Dropping files outside Obsidian\n\n- This will create an `obsidian://` URL in the external application for the Obsidian note that you dragged.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Advanced topics/HTML sanitization/","title":"HTML Sanitization"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Obsidian sanitizes html for security reasons. Because it runs locally, scripting vulnerabilities are a more serious problem than they would be in a web applications. Accordingly, we are probably a bit more strict than you may be used to, and you may run into issues if you try to do things like embedding `<script>` tags in a note. However, the vast majority of people will never encounter issues with this.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Advanced topics/How Obsidian stores data/","title":"How Obsidian Stores Data"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"We believe [[Obsidian#How we're different|your data is always yours to own and control]]. Your notes are stored in markdown, which is an open format based on plain text files, and so should be readable in the future by any computer that can deal with text files. You can freely edit notes in other software, even while having them open in Obsidian.\n\n### Per vault data\n\nThere is, however, some data that is needed by the software that is not stored in markdown. Obsidian creates a directory called `.obsidian` in the root of any vault you create. This contains your configuration, including custom hotkeys and which plugins are enabled. Any directory starting with a `.` is invisible on most systems, so you will probably never see it unless you try. If you delete this directory, none of your data will be gone, but you will lose your custom settings. It will be recreated when you open that vault in Obsidian again. If you are using `git`, it's probably best to `ignore` the `.obsidian/workspace` file, because the this file stores your panes and opened files, but we haven't observed any other issues with including it.\n\n### System directory\n\nObsidian also stores some information in the system directory. This is different per Operating System; on Mac it's `/Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/obsidian`, on Windows `%APPDATA%\\Obsidian\\`, and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/Obsidian/` or `~/.config/Obsidian/` on Linux. As a result, we recommend against creating a vault in this directory.\n\nAside from that, though, you can create a Vault anywhere your operating system will allow. Obsidian files sync fine with Dropbox, iCloud, OneDrive, git, and every other syncing service we've tried thus far.\n\n### Symbolic Links\n\nStarting in v0.11.1, Obsidian will recognize symbolic links and junctions. We do not officially recommend using these, but we recognize there are valid use-cases for them. Use them at your own risk.\n\nBeware that there are many pitfalls to using symbolic links, and some of them could have serious consequences such as data-loss, file corruption, or could crash Obsidian.\n\nBelow are some limitations or issues we are aware of that you may want to keep in mind:\n\n- Symlink loops are disallowed, to prevent crashing Obsidian due to an infinite loop.\n- Symlink targets must be fully disjoint from the vault root or any other symlink targets. Disjoint means one folder does not contain another, or vice versa. Obsidian will ignore any symlink to a parent folder of the vault, or from one folder in the vault to another folder in the same vault. It is a safeguard to ensure you don't end up with duplicated files in your vault, which could cause links to become ambiguous.\n- Symlinks may not play well with Obsidian sync, or _any other kind of sync_. If the target of a symlink is itself a directory that's synced by a different Obsidian vault, you could (potentially) end up with sync conflicts or data loss. Some sync tools (e.g. git) do not follow symlinks, but rather synchronize the _path_ the symlink points to, which may produce undesirable results if you share your vault with other people that way.\n- Obsidian's file manager cannot move files across device boundaries, so if you symlink to a folder on a different drive from your vault, you will not be able to drag files between that folder and other folders using Obsidian's file explorer. (You'll need to use your OS's explorer for such moves, and Obsidian will see the move as a deletion and the creation of a new file. It will also _not_ update any links that depended on the path of that file.)\n- File symlinks (as opposed to folder symlinks) _may_ work, but are not officially supported at this time. Changes performed outside of Obsidian are not watched for, so if you change the file directly, Obsidian will not detect the change, update search indexes, etc.\n- Symlinking things under the `.obsidian/` directory in order to share them between vaults **has a high chance of corrupting your settings**, unless you _really really_ know what you're doing. If you decide to go this way, at least have backups.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Advanced topics/Insider builds/","title":"Insider Builds"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Insider builds are experimental versions of Obsidian that are released to Catalyst license owners, on an opt-in basis.\n\nPlease note that insider builds are less stable than public versions, so if you prefer a smoother version, you don't have to enable it.\n\n### How to enable insider build\n\nIf you are a [[Catalyst license|Catalyst supporter]], you have access to Insider Builds before the general public. To access these, go to Settings => Account, and log in with the password you used on the Obsidian site. Then go to Settings => About, and turn on Insider Builds there.\n\n![[Insider.png]]\n\n### Report issues\n\nIf you're on our Discord server, you can go to the #insider-build channel to report issues. If you're filing a bug report on the forum, be sure to note the version you're using, so that we can improve it before rolling it out to everyone."},{"fields":{"slug":"/Advanced topics/Third-party plugins/","title":"Third-Party Plugins"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Obsidian allows developers to write third-party plugins to extend Obsidian's functionality.\n\nRight now, the plugin API is in alpha status.

Refer to the sample plugin on how to release updates for your plugin.\n\n### For users\n\n#### Safe Mode\n\nBy default, Obsidian has Safe Mode turned on to protect you from potential harm. Under Safe Mode, no third-party plugin will run.\n\nPlease be aware that third-party plugins can access files on your computer, connect to the internet, and even install additional programs. To read more about plugin security, [[#Plugin security|see here]].\n\nIn order to install third-party plugins, you need to turn off Safe Mode in Settings => Community plugins => Safe mode.\n\n#### Discover and install community plugins\n\nAfter disabling Safe Mode, you can find third-party plugins created by the community in Settings => Community plugins => Browse.\n\nOn this page, you can browse plugins by popularity, or search for specific plugins. Click on a plugin to see details and instruction from the plugin author. In the details page, you can click \"Install\" to install a plugin.\n\nAfter installing, you can then find the installed plugins under Settings => Community plugins. They need to be enabled in order to take effect. You can also uninstall them there.\n\n### Plugin security\n\nThanks for trusting Obsidian with your data! It means a lot to us, and we take security very seriously. That includes third-party plugins too.\n\nDue to technical reasons with our platform, we're unable to restrict plugins to a specific permission or access level. Since we offer Obsidian for free, currently we're unable to manually review each plugin.\n\nThe good news is that Obsidian has an amazing and passionate community, so we rely on community trust to ensure security of third-party plugins.\n\nIn general, you should be able to trust most of the popular plugins from the community. We require all community third-party plugins to be open sourced on GitHub. **If you're working with sensitive data, we recommend you to inspect the plugin code before installing it, so that your security needs are met.** You can find a link to the plugin repository on the plugin detail page.\n\nIf you find any security flaws with third-party plugins, contact the plugin author by adding an issue on GitHub. If you believe the plugin is malicious, contact us to get the plugin investigated and removed.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Advanced topics/Using obsidian URI/","title":"Using Obsidian URI"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Obsidian supports a custom URI protocol `obsidian://` which can be used to trigger various actions within the app. This is commonly used on MacOS and mobile apps for automation and cross-app workflows.\n\nIf you have Obsidian installed, this link will open the app on your device: [Click here](obsidian://open)\n\n## Installing Obsidian URI\n\nTo make sure your operating system redirect `obsidian://` URIs to the Obsidian app, there may be additional steps you need to perform.\n\n- On Windows, running the app once should be sufficient. This will register for the `obsidian://` custom protocol handler in the Windows registry.\n- On MacOS, running the app once should be sufficient, however, your app **must** be installer version 0.8.12 or later.\n- On Linux, there's a much more involved process:\n\t- First, ensure you create a `obsidian.desktop` file. [See here for details](https://developer.gnome.org/integration-guide/stable/desktop-files.html.en)\n\t- Ensure that your desktop file specifies the `Exec` field as `Exec=executable %u`. The `%u` is used to pass the `obsidian://` URIs to the app.\n\t- If you're using the AppImage installer, you may have to unpack it using `Obsidian-x.y.z.AppImage --appimage-extract`. Then make sure the `Exec` directive points to the unpacked executable.\n\n## Using Obsidian URIs\n\nObsidian URIs are typically in this format:\n\n```\nobsidian://action?param1=value&param2=value\n```\n\n- The `action` is usually the action that you would like to perform.\n\n### Encoding\n\n==Important==\n\nEnsure that your values are properly URI encoded. For example, forward slash characters `/` must be encoded as `%2F` and space characters must be encoded as `%20`.\n\nThis is especially important because an improperly encoded \"reserved\" character may break the interpretation of the URI. [See here for details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding)\n\n### Available actions\n\n#### Action `open`\n\nDescription: Opens an Obsidian vault, and possibly open a file within that vault.\n\nPossible parameters:\n\n- `vault` can be either the vault name, or the vault ID.\n\t- The vault name is simply the name of the vault folder.\n\t- The vault ID is the random 16-character code assigned to the vault. This ID is unique per folder on your computer. Example: `ef6ca3e3b524d22f`. There isn't an easy way to find this ID yet, one will be offered at a later date in the vault switcher. Currently it can be found in `%appdata%/obsidian/obsidian.json` for Windows. For MacOS, replace `%appdata%` with `~/Library/Application Support/`. For Linux, replace `%appdata%` with `~/.config/`.\n- `file` can be either a file name, or a path from the vault root to the specified file.\n\t- To resolve the target file, Obsidian uses the same link resolution system as a regular `[[wikilink]]` within the vault.\n\t- If the file extension is `md`, the extension can be omitted.\n- `path` an absolute file system path to a file.\n\t- Using this parameter will override both `vault` and `file`.\n\t- This will cause the app to search for the most specific vault which contains the specified file path.\n\t- Then the rest of the path replaces the `file` parameter.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault`\n\tThis opens the vault `my vault`. If the vault is already open, focus on the window.\n\n- `obsidian://open?vault=ef6ca3e3b524d22f`\n\tThis opens the vault identified by the ID `ef6ca3e3b524d22f`.\n\n- `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file=my%20note`\n\tThis opens the note `my note` in the vault `my vault`, assuming `my note` exists and the file is `my note.md`.\n\n- `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file=my%20note.md`\n\tThis also opens the note `my note` in the vault `my vault`.\n\n- `obsidian://open?vault=my%20vault&file=path%2Fto%2Fmy%20note`\n\tThis opens the note located at `path/to/my note` in the vault `my vault`.\n\n- `obsidian://open?path=%2Fhome%2Fuser%2Fmy%20vault%2Fpath%2Fto%2Fmy%20note`\n\tThis will look for any vault that contains the path `/home/user/my vault/path/to/my note`. Then, the rest of the path is passed to the `file` parameter. For example, if a vault exists at `/home/user/my vault`, then this would be equivalent to `file` parameter set to `path/to/my note`.\n\n- `obsidian://open?path=D%3A%5CDocuments%5CMy%20vault%5CMy%20note`\n\tThis will look for any vault that contains the path `D:\\Documents\\My vault\\My note`. Then, the rest of the path is passed to the `file` parameter. For example, if a vault exists at `D:\\Documents\\My vault`, then this would be equivalent to `file` parameter set to `My note`.\n\t\n#### Action `search`\n\nDescription: Opens the search pane for a vault, and optionally perform a search query.\n\nPossible parameters:\n\n- `vault` can be either the vault name, or the vault ID. Same as action `open`.\n- `query` (optional) The search query to perform.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `obsidian://search?vault=my%20vault`\n\tThis opens the vault `my vault`, and opens the search pane.\n\n- `obsidian://search?vault=my%20vault&query=MOC`\n\tThis opens the vault `my vault`, opens the search pane, and performs a search for `MOC`.\n\t\n#### Action `new`\n\nDescription: Creates a new note in the vault, optionally with some content.\n\nPossible parameters:\n\n- `vault` can be either the vault name, or the vault ID. Same as action `open`.\n- `name` the file name to be created. If this is specified, the file location will be chosen based on your \"Default location for new notes\" preferences.\n- `file` a vault absolute path, including the name. Will override `name` if specified.\n- `path` a globally absolute path. Works similar to the `path` option in the `open` action, which will override both `vault` and `file`.\n- `content` (optional) the contents of the note.\n- `silent` (optional) set this if you don't want to open the new note.\n\nExamples:\n\n- `obsidian://new?vault=my%20vault&name=my%20note`\n\tThis opens the vault `my vault`, and creates a new note called `my note`.\n- `obsidian://new?vault=my%20vault&path=path%2Fto%2Fmy%20note`\n\tThis opens the vault `my vault`, and creates a new note at `path/to/my note`.\n\t\n#### Action `hook-get-address`\n\nDescription: Endpoint for use with [Hook](https://hookproductivity.com/).

These alternative names are what we call \"aliases\".\n\nFor example, you might want to refer to your partner by their full name, first name, or a nickname. Or you might want to refer to \"artificial intelligence\" by its abbreviation \"AI\". If you know multiple languages, you may want to refer to the same concept with their name in the same language that the rest of the note is written in.\n\n### Set aliases\n\nStarting in 0.9.16, you're able to specify the \"aliases\" property in a note's [[YAML front matter]] like so:\n\n```\n---\naliases: [AI, Artificial Intelligence]\n---\n```\n\nPlease note that this section must be placed at the very top of a note to take effect.\n\nIn the future, we'll consider more user-friendly ways to manage aliases than manually writing them in front matter.\n\n### Link with aliases\n\nOnce you've set aliases for a file, you can write `[[alias]]` to link to the original page. A redirect icon will show up in the auto-complete list like so:\n\n![[Insert alises.png]]\n\nAn internal link with display text will get inserted like so: `[[Add aliases to note|alias]]`.\n\nNote: the link to alias is **NOT** inserted as `[[alias]]` for interoperability, so that other software can recognize it as well.\n\n### Find unlinked mentions\n\nAfter you've set aliases for a note, you can find unlinked mentions by both its name and its aliases.\n\nFor example, after setting \"AI\" as an alias for \"Artificial intelligence\", you'll see mentions of \"AI\" in other files in the [[Backlinks]] section.\n\nIf you decide to link this mention, a link with display text set to the alias will be created for you.

Creating your custom theme CSS file in the themes directory `YOUR_VAULT/.obsidian/themes/YOUR_CUSTOM_THEME.css`\n2. Enabling it in the theme dropdown under `Settings` => `Appearance` => `Themes`\n\nFor more information on how to customize styles of the graph, you can find more information in [[Graph view]].\n\n### Use Themes and/or CSS snippets\n\nYou can find this configuration in `Settings` => `Appearance`. You can choose a community theme or set the theme you developed yourself. If you set a community theme, it will be automatically placed in the correct folder. If you develop your own theme, you have to put it in the shown folder location yourself.\n\nCSS snippets are supposed to be small pieces of CSS for small changes you want to make/things you want to add. These snippets have to be placed in the shown directory.\n\nYou can go to the respective directories by clicking on the folder buttons. If the folder isn't created yet, it will be. In case your snippets or theme don't show up after you've put them there, you can click the button next to the folder icon to refresh the list.\n\n## Obsidian Publish styles\n\nAt this time, [[Obsidian Publish]] is unable to automatically detect the vault's configured [[Add custom styles#Themes|theme]] and publish the respective styles. \n\nA workaround for this limitation is to:\n\n1. Go into `YOUR_VAULT/.obsidian/themes/CURRENT_THEME_FOLDER`;\n2. Copy the primary CSS file `CURRENT_THEME.css` in the folder;\n3. Paste it in the root directory of your vault (`YOUR_VAULT`);\n4. Rename the CSS file as `publish.css`;\n5. In the publish plugin, upload the `publish.css` file;\n6.

The one in the left pane is a text file, which you can edit using Markdown syntax. The one in the right pane is a _Preview_ of the same text file if you were to export it as HTML, or as a PDF document. Note that some things look different in Preview, and, most obviously, links are not in brackets. To follow a link, click on it in the Preview pane. You can follow links in the Editor pane as well, by holding down `Ctrl/Cmd` and clicking on the link. If you want to go back to the page you were on before, use the shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd-alt-LeftArrow`\n\nAlternatively, the notes that link to the one you're currently on will be shown in the **Backlinks Panel** on the right (find more about Backlinks [[Backlinks|here.]])\n\nIf you get lost at any time, or just want to explore what else Obsidian can do, `Ctrl/Cmd-P` brings up the Command Palette. You can type commands there, like \"Navigate back\", and you'll see options filter to a short list, along with hotkey shortcuts if they have them. \n\nAt base, Obsidian is a tool for working with a bunch of markdown files that are stored on your computer. If you're not familiar with markdown, it's just plain text with some formatting that makes it powerful (for more on that, see [[Format your notes|Markdown]]) . As a result, if you want to use obsidian for keeping regular notes on just about anything, it will work great. \n\nLet's say you want to write a note about your favorite band. Just type the name of the note surrounded by two square brackets, like `[[My Favorite Band]]`\n\nTry it here (make sure you're typing in the Editor pane): \n\nYou'll notice that the text and the brackets turn blue. That means it's a link now. Click on that link in the Preview (or `Cmd-click` in the Editor), and you'll see a blank note. Write whatever you want there, and when you're done, come back here with `Cmd-alt-left`, or by clicking the name of this note ([[Basic note taking]]) in the **Backlinks** to the right. To learn more about navigating links, see [[Internal link]].\n\n---\n\nNotice that your new note showed up automatically in the File Explorer to the left. Obsidian automatically creates files when you click a link to a file that does not exist. This means you can `[[write naturally]]` about `[[whatever comes to mind]]` and then go back and create the new notes at your leisure. This makes Obsidian a fantastic tool for thinking freely in notes without having to worry about where to file them. And if you decide that a title is not what you actually meant, you can change the file name at the top of this window, and Obsidian will automatically update all links to it.\n\nFrom there, you can make any kind of structure you want. Many people will want to make a `Table of Contents` note for listing major groups of notes. You can also use #tags to create categories (if you click that it will show you every note that contains #tags ). Really, the structure you build should be whatever works for you. We suggest you just start with what feels natural. Obsidian is flexible enough that it should be relatively simple to rearrange things later.\n\nBe aware! The note you just created is in these Help documents, which will be overwritten on new releases. ==If you created anything you care to keep, it should be put into a different vault==. For details on how to do that, see [[Working with multiple vaults]].\n\nIf you want an example of a more advanced technique, you might look into the [sample workflows on our forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/example-workflows-in-obsidian/1093).\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/How to/Capture information/","title":"Capture Information"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"### Copy and paste\n\nWhen you see something useful online, you can simply select the text, copy, and paste in Obsidian.

Use the `![[filename.png]]` syntax like so:\n\n![[Engelbart.jpg]]\n\n![[Excerpt from Mother of All Demos (1968).ogg]]\n\nYou can embed a PDF file in your notes with the same syntax. Additionally, you can write `![[My File.pdf#page=number]]` to open to that specific page of the PDF directly.\n\n### Embed notes\n\nYou can embed a note also, with the same syntax:\n\n![[Accepted file formats]]\n\n### iframe\n\n\"iframe\" is a way to embed a web page in another. It's useful because Markdown can accept HTML, which is a simple language to construct the web pages we see every day.\n\nFor example:\n\n```html\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnTvZWp5Q7o\"></iframe>\n```\n\nProduces:\n\n<iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnTvZWp5Q7o\"></iframe>\n\nThe basic syntax is:\n\n```html\n<iframe src=\"INSERT YOUR URL HERE\"></iframe>\n```\n\nSome websites have quirks that don't allow you to embed them. For example, you can't embed a YouTube video by using its normal URL, but you can use its embed URL which is `https://www.youtube.com/embed/VIDEO_ID`.\n\nIf you want to embed a website, try searching for \"{website} embed iframe\".\n\nFor example, you can embed Twitter tweets like so as suggested by search results:\n\n```html\n<iframe\n  border=\"0\"\n  frameborder=\"0\"\n  height=\"250\"\n  width=\"550\"\n  src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjack%2Fstatus%2F20\"\n>\n</iframe>\n```\n\n<iframe border=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"250\" width=\"550\"  \n src=\"https://twitframe.com/show?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjack%2Fstatus%2F20\"></iframe>\n\n---\n\n### Developer notes\n\nThe syntax is inspired by Markdown's image syntax. We had two observations:\n\n1.  `[Image](link.png)` links to the image, but `![Image](link.png)` actually displays it.\n\n2.  The internal link syntax is based on this assumption: `[[My page]]` is a shortcut (or \"syntactic sugar\" if you will) for `[My page](My page)`.\n\nTo combine these two things, we can come up with a third pattern:`![[My page]]` should be equivalent to `![My page](My page)` , which by the image convention, if the title is the same as the link, should display it.\n\nThere are other implementations out there, for example Roam Research uses `{{embed: ((NODE_ID))}}`. We have also considered using the `((Page name))` syntax too, but we feel like `![[Page name]]` is more consistent, more familiar, and leaves more room so that the other symbols to have their own meanings.\n\n#### Resize images\n\nYou can resize images using the following syntax:\n\nFor markdown images, use `![AltText|100x100](https://url/to/image.png)`\n\nFor embeds, use `![[image.png|100x100]]`\n\nTo have the image scale according to its aspect ratio, omit the height `![[image.png|100]]`\n\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/How to/Folding/","title":"Folding"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Folding text is an extremely powerful tool for outlining or writing, in order to focus on what you're working on. \n\nTo use folding, go to Settings (the gear icon on the left) => Editor and turn on `Fold indent` and `Fold heading`.\n\nObsidian has the ability to fold both markdown headers and indented lists.

You can check which packages are supported in Mathjax [here](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/input/tex/extensions/index.html).\n\n### Comments\n\nUse `%%` to enclose comments, which will be parsed as Markdown, but will not show up in the preview.\n\n```md\nHere is some inline comments: %%You can't see this text%% (Can't see it)\n\nHere is a block comment:\n%%\nIt can span\nmultiple lines\n%%\n```\n\nHere is some inline comments: %%You can't see this text%% (can't see it in preview)\n\nHere is a block comment: (can't see it in preview either)\n%%\nIt can span\nmultiple lines\n%%\n\n### Diagram\n\nObsidian uses [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) to render diagrams and charts. Mermaid also provides [a helpful live editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor).\n\n````mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?\n    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?\n    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!\n    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!\n```</code></pre>\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?\n    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?\n    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!\n    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!\n````\n\nObsidian supports linking to notes in Mermaid:\n\n````mermaid\ngraph TD\n\nBiology --> Chemistry\n\nclass Biology,Chemistry internal-link;\n```</code></pre>\n\nAn easier way to do it is the following: ^376b9d\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n\nA[Biology]\nB[Chemistry]\n\nA --> B\n\nclass A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z internal-link;\n```</code></pre>\n\nThis way, all the note names (at least until `Z[note name]`) are all automatically assigned the class `internal-link` when you use this snippet.\n\nIf you use special characters in your note names, you need to put the note name in double quotes.\n`\"⨳ special character\"`\nIt looks like this if you follow the [[Format your notes#^376b9d|second option]]:\n`A[\"⨳ special character\"]`\n\n## Developer notes\n\nWe strive for maximum capability without breaking any existing formats, therefore we use a slightly unorthodox combination of flavors of markdown. It is broadly CommonMark, with the addition of some functionality from GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM), some latex support, and our chosen embed syntax, which you can read more about at [[Accepted file formats]].\n\n\n````\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/How to/Import data/","title":"Import Data"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"There are a few differences between the way various PKM and note taking systems work that mean moving between them can be a little complicated. For the most part, if whatever you're using can be converted to markdown, it will work fairly well within Obsidian. But some things, like tags and links, can be tricky.\n\nOn our Forum there is a [post collecting methods that other people have developed](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/meta-post-migration-workflows/768). Right now, it includes:\n\n- [Import from Notion](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/import-from-notion/636)\n- [Import from Notion (automated)](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/notion-2-obsidian-migration-instructions/2728)\n- [Import from Evernote](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/import-from-evernote/108)\n- [Import from OneNote](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/new-tool-for-migration-from-onenote-updated-and-improved-version/3055)\n- [Import from Apple Notes](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/migrate-from-apple-notes-to-obsidian/732)\n- [Import from Bear](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/import-from-bear-app/2284)\n- [Import from Zkn3](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/migrating-from-zkn3-to-obsidian-without-losing-your-tags-and-internal-links-documentation/7457)\n- [Import from TiddlyWiki 5](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/migrate-from-tiddlywiki-5-to-obsidian/731)\n\nBut if you don't see your system on this list, check out the forum post, someone may have solved your issue since this document was written.\n\nAlso of note, the makers of nvUltra, another markdown-based note-taking program, have a list on their website of [ways to export to nvUltra](https://nvultra.com/help/importing).

Choose \"Export all\" in the menu:\n> ![[Pasted image.png]]\n\n> 2. Click the blue \"Export all\" button:\n> ![[Pasted image 1.png]]\n\n> 3. Unzip the \"Roam-Export-xxxxxxxxxxxxx.zip\" into a folder.\n\n> 4. Click on the vault icon (the tooltip should say \"Open another vault\") on the bottom left corner in the app, and select \"Open folder as vault\".\n> Pick the folder you just unzipped to.\n\n> 5. Use our [[markdown format converter]] to convert Roam Research's Markdown format into Obsidian's format.\n> It can be used turn `#tag` into Obsidian `[[links]]`.\n> It can also convert `^^highlight^^` into `==highlight==`.\n\n\n### From Bear\n\nIf you're importing from Bear, the [[Markdown format converter]] plugin has an option to convert `::highlight::` to `==highlight==`.\n\n### Using Zettelkasten\n\nIf you've been using the Zettelkasten method to structure your notes, here's something you might want to know:\n\nLinks in Obsidian require a full match to the note name. This means that `[[202001010000]]` will not properly link to `[[202001010000 My Note]]`.\n\nIn order to fix that, you can use our [[markdown format converter]] to convert your Zettelkasten links into either `[[202001010000 My Note]]` or `[[202001010000 My Note|My Note]]`.\n\nYou might also be interested in the [[Zettelkasten prefixer]] plugin.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/How to/Internal link/","title":"Internal Link"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Internal links are the backbone of your knowledge network.\n\n### Link to files\n\nTo create an internal link, simply type `[[`. This will prompt you with the list of notes you can link to. Use `Up arrow` and `Down arrow` to navigate the suggestion list and `Enter` to select the current highlighted link.\n\n### Link to headings\n\nYou can also link to specific headers in files. Start typing a link like you would normally. When the note you want is highlighted, press `#` instead of `Enter` and you'll see a list of headings in that file. Continue typing or navigate with arrow keys as before, press `#`again at each subheading you want to add, and `Enter` to complete the link. \n\nTo make the link display different text than its real note name in Preview, use the vertical pipe (`Shift+|`) For example: [[Internal link|Custom Link Name in Preview!]] This can be combined with linking to headers, as in [[Folding#By way of example|Example of Folding]].\n\n### Following Links\n\n- To follow a link in the Preview pane, simply click on the link.\n- To follow a link in a new panel from Preview, click while pressing `Ctrl/Cmd`''\n- To follow a link in the Editor pane, click the link while pressing `Ctrl/Cmd`.\n- To follow a link in a new panel from the Editor, click the link while pressing `Ctrl/Cmd-Shift`''\n- To see a preview of the linked content without leaving the current note, enable the [[page preview]] plugin and a popup window will be displayed.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/How to/Keyboard shortcuts/","title":"Keyboard Shortcuts"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"If you have the [[Command palette]] enabled, You can use `Ctrl/Cmd+P` to bring it up, which will show you all currently available commands and their keyboard shortcuts.\n\nMost keyboard shortcuts can be customized for your needs in Settings => Hotkeys. \n\nThe default keyboard shortcuts are listed below. \n\nFunction                                            |   | Shortcut\n--------------------------------------------------- | - | --------------------------\nSave current file                                   |   | `Ctrl/Cmd+S`\nCreate new note                                     |   | `Ctrl/Cmd+N`\nCommand palette: Open command palette               |   | `Ctrl/Cmd+P`\nQuick switcher: Open quick switcher                 |   | `Ctrl/Cmd+O`\nSearch: Search in all files                         |   | `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+F`\nGraph view: Open graph view                         |   | `Ctrl/Cmd+G`\nStarred: Star/unstar current file                   |   | Blank\nAudio recorder: start recording                     |   | Blank\nAudio recorder: stop recording                      |   | Blank\nMarkdown format importer: Open Markdown converter   |   | Blank\nDaily notes: Open today's note                      |   | Blank\nZettelkasten prefixer: Create new Zettelkasten note |   | Blank\nRandom note: Open random note                       |   | Blank\nNavigate back                                       |   | `Ctrl/Cmd-Alt+Left arrow`\nNavigate forward                                    |   | `Ctrl/Cmd-Alt+Right arrow`\nOpen vault location                                 |   | Blank\nUse dark mode                                       |   | Blank\nUse light mode                                      |   | Blank\nSearch current file                                 |   | `Ctrl/Cmd-F`\nToggle edit/preview mode                            |   | `Ctrl/Cmd E`\nDelete current file                                 |   | Blank\nSplit vertical                                      |   | Blank\nSplit horizontal                                    |   | Blank\nClose active pane                                   |   | Blank\nClose all other panes                               |   | Blank\nOpen settings                                       |   | `Ctrl/Cmd ,`\n\n**Editing**\n\nFunction                    |   | Shortcut\n--------------------------- | - | ---------------\nBold Selected Text          |   | `Ctrl/Cmd-B`\nItalic Selected Text        |   | `Ctrl/Cmd-I`\nInsert External link        |   | `Ctrl/Cmd-K`\nIndent                      |   | `Ctrl/Cmd-]`\nUnindent                    |   | `Ctrl/Cmd-[`\nJump into selected backlink |   | `Alt/Opt-Enter`\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/How to/Link to blocks/","title":"Link to Blocks"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"In Obsidian 0.9.5 or higher, in addition to [[Internal link#Link to headings|linking to headings]], you can also link to blocks.\n\n### What is a block\n\nA \"block\" can be a paragraph, a blockquote, a list item, etc. In general, anything that has empty lines before and after is a block. ^dcf64c\n\n### Link to blocks\n\nTo link to a block in a specific file, first type `[[filename` to bring up a list of matched files. After selecting a file, type `^` and continue typing to search for blocks to link to.\n\nOnce you hit enter, a link to that block will be generated for you, in the format similar to `[[filename#^dcf64c]]`, where `dcf64c` is the block ID that was just generated for you.\n\nIf you're not sure which file the block is in, another method is to type `[[^^` and search for blocks in all files. This will search through all the blocks in your vault, so expect a bit of delay if your vault is large.\n\nFor example, [[#^dcf64c]] is a link to a block above.\n\n### Embed or transclude blocks\n\nSimilar to [[Embed files|files embeds]], you can simply use `!` in front of a block link to embed it.\n\nHere's an example:\n\n![[#^dcf64c]]\n\n### Manual block IDs\n\nIf you want human readable block IDs, you can manually put `^your-id` after a block. Make sure there's at least one space if you're putting the ID at end of a line.\n\nTo refer to complex blocks like tables, put the block ID on its own after the block, and make sure there is an empty line both before and after the block ID.\n\nAfter you add the block ID manually, when you refer to that block, `your-id` will be used instead of a randomly generated block ID.\n\nNote that only letters, numbers, and dashes are allowed in manual block IDs.\n\n### Interoperability\n\nPlease be aware that block reference is not part of standard Markdown, but rather Obsidian's specific flavor of Markdown. That means these links will not work outside of Obsidian.\n\nYou can still find referenced block by searching for the block ID, although that's a rather manual process. The connection is not lost as long as you have software that can search in a folder.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/How to/Manage attachments/","title":"Manage Attachments"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"## Add an attachment\n\nThere are several ways to include attachments in your notes:\n\n1. Copy and paste;\n2. Drag and drop;\n3. Download or copy file to vault folder.\n\nAfter being added, these attachment files are just normal files and can still be accessed through your file system. \n\nPlease note that only [[Accepted file formats]] are handled.\n\n### Copy and paste\n\nPasting a local file from your system explorer or your clipboard will put the file into your vault.\n\nThis is very handy when combined with screenshot tools.\n\n### Drag and drop\n\nIf you drag and drop a file from your file explorer, it will be copied to your vault as well.\n\n### Download or copy to vault folder\n\nThis can work well when paired with [[Capture information#Use a clipper extension|clipper extensions]].\n\nYou can also download images from your browser into your vault folder directly for later reference.\n\n## Change default attachment location\n\nBy default, new attachments will be dropped in the root of your vault. You can fine tune this setting in Settings => Files & Links => \"Default location for new attachments\".\n\n### Choose a folder\n\nYou can choose a fixed folder to always place your attachments in. To do this, choose \"In the folder specified below\", and choose a folder in your vault in the new field that appears.\n\nAlternatively, you can right click on a folder in [[File explorer]] and choose \"Set as attachment folder\".\n\n### Same folder as current file\n\nSometimes, you may want the attachment files to always be in the same folder as the note you're working on. In this case, choose \"Same folder as current file\".\n\n### Under the current folder\n\nYou can also choose to save attachments to a folder underneath the folder that the current file is in.\n\nTo do this, choose the \"Subfolder under current folder\" option, and write the name of the subfolder in the field that appears. For example, if you write `assets`, and your note is in `VAULT/folder/path/`, the attachments will be added to `VAULT/folder/path/assets` when you're working on this note.\n\nYou don't need to create the subfolder beforehand; if it doesn't exist, Obsidian will create it for you."},{"fields":{"slug":"/How to/Preview and edit modes/","title":"Preview and Edit Modes"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"In obsidian, a document can be viewed in either edit mode or preview mode.

But, you can also see under Unlinked mentions that I wrote the name of this note but did not make it a link.\n\nThis can be a very powerful way of seeing connections between your notes that you did not know you were making when you wrote them. If, for example, you have a note named for a concept that comes up often in your field, you will be able to see easily when it is mentioned in other notes, and thus understand relationships between ideas you might not have otherwise.\n\nIf a reference appears in the Unlinked mentions, and you want to link it, hovering over the text will bring up a Link button. Clicking this will automatically surround the highlighted text in the referenced note with brackets, making it into an explicit link.\n\nYou can also create a separate, dedicated backlinks pane for a note under the More Options menu. This will be a [[linked pane]] connected to the note, and can be moved around anywhere, as described in [[Pane layout]]. There's also an option to do this in the [[Command palette]].\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/How to/Working with multiple cursors/","title":"Working with Multiple Cursors"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"If you hold down `Alt` (`option` on mac) and click, you can create multiple cursors.

The active pane is marked with highlighted bar under the title, and its title is more visible than the inactive panes.\n\nTo open files in new panes, hold down `Ctrl/Cmd` while you click in Preview mode (`Shift + Ctrl/Cmd` in Edit mode). This applies to a number of places, including [[file explorer]], [[backlinks]] (both links and unlinked mentions), [[search]] results, and [[graph view]]. It also applies to buttons; instead of previewing in the current pane, you can `Cmd+click` the preview button to preview in a new pane. When using the Quick Switcher, holding down `Cmd/Ctrl`when hitting `Enter` will open in a new pane. \n\n---\n\n##### 2. You can also create new panes by ==splitting==.\n\nTo create other layouts, you can split the current pane in half either horizontally or vertically. Do this with the menu at the top right of the pane, use the command palette, or set a [[Keyboard shortcuts]].\n\n![[Pasted image 16.png]]\n\n---\n\n##### 3. If you want a sticky pane that does not get replaced even when it's active, ==pin it==.\n\nThis is great if you're working on something and want to use the other panes as temporary reference panes. Pin it to make sure it never gets replaced.\n\n![[Pasted image 17.png]]\n\nPinned panes will have a highlighted pin icon instead of a grey one.\n\n---\n\n##### 4.

A Vault consists of a folder, and any sub-folders within it.

This is useful, for example, if you have one Vault where you keep notes but a different one in which you do long-form writing.\n\nA new or existing Vault can be opened from the button just above the Settings gear.\n\n![[Vault picker.png]]\n\nYou have the option to either open an existing folder of markdown files, create a new vault (which essentially just creates a new folder that you will put markdown files into), or opening a special vault containing these help files. The Help Vault is stored in a special Obsidian directory (see [[How Obsidian stores data]]), but aside from that, it's a directory of files just like any other.\n\n[[Internal link|Internal Links]] are not shared across Vaults. If you have one Vault inside another Vault, this can get confusing, so we recommend not doing that.\n\nAlways remember, a Vault is just a collection of markdown files. You can use whatever file management techniques you would normally to move them around on your file system, and Obsidian will automatically refresh to keep up.\n\n### Transfer settings between vaults\n\nAll settings, themes, and plugins are stored in the `.obsidian` folder under your vault. If you copy this folder from one vault to another, all the settings will be transferred as well. You may need to restart Obsidian for all of the settings to take effect.\n\nThis folder is hidden in some operating systems.

A tag is essentially a clickable search through your entire Vault for a term. For example, clicking on #tags will bring up a search with all notes that contain that tag. Most people use them for broad categories of things, like a class you might be taking notes in or a type of idea. Some Zettelkasten practitioners like to use them as \"entry points\" for thinking about connected ideas. But ultimately, they are flexible enough that you can use them in any way you would like.\n\n### Tag pane\n\nIf you have the [[Tag pane]] plugin enabled, you will see a list of all tags that are used across all of your notes, sorted by frequency. Clicking on any of those will activate that search.\n\nThis will allow you to search exact matches of a tag. For example, when clicking , as per usual, but if you want to find all instances of `maintag` with all subtags, you can still use the [[Search]] to look for `#maintag`. This is useful in cases where you have subcategories of things but you also want to be able to easily find all instances of the higher category.\n\n### Allowed characters\n\nSpaces are not allowed in tags. So, if you want to have multiple words in a tag, you can use these formats:\n\n- CamelCase: #TwoWords\n- Underscore: #two_words\n- Dash: #two-words\n\nThe only symbols allowed are:\n\n1. `_` (underscore) and `-` (dash) to separate words;\n2. `/` (forward slash) for [[Tag pane#Nested tags|nested tags]].\n\nNumbers are allowed in the tag, ==as long as the tag is not purely numeric==.

As for any notes you choose **not** to publish, you can be confident that those notes remain completely private, and Obsidian Publish has no knowledge of them.\n\n### Backing up\n\nPlease note that Obsidian Publish is not to be used as a backup for your content. Make sure you always have a personal backup copy of your site using your preferred backup method. Our efforts on Obsidian Publish will be more focused on functionality, ease of use, and site availability.\n\n### Demo\n\nThere's a good chance that you're already viewing this article on our official site powered by Obsidian Publish.\n\nIf not, you can visit it here: https://publish.obsidian.md/help.\n\n### What's included\n\nThe Obsidian Publish service lets you create your site directly from within the Obsidian app by choosing the notes you want to publish.\n\nTo customize your site, you can choose between light and dark mode, and also toggle between readable line length and full page length.\n\nThere are several components which can be turned on or off from the [[Publish|Publish plugin]]. Changes to these options will be reflected on your published site once the cache clears, typically within 5 minutes.\n\n##### Navigation\n\nEnabling this option adds a navigation sidebar displaying all published pages and the folders that contain them. Viewers will see the current open note highlighted, and can click on any other note to navigate.\n\n##### Search bar\n\nAdds a search bar to page. This bar can be used to search for pages, aliases, and headings within pages. It does not currently search through the full text content of the site.\n\n##### Graph view\n\nDisplays a local graph of the page currently open. This uses the same rendering engine as the [[Graph view]] plugin in Obsidian.\n\n##### Table of contents\n\nDisplays a table of contents for the page currently open. The list is generated from headings within the page, similar to the [[Outline]] plugin. Viewers navigating the note will see the corresponding heading highlighted as they scroll, and can click on another heading to immediately navigate to it.\n\n##### Backlinks\n\nDisplays a section at the end of each page called \"Linked to this page\", containing backlinks from other pages. If there are no backlinks, the section will not be displayed.\n\n##### Tags\n\nWhen the reader clicks on a tag, they can see a list of other pages that includes the same tag.\n\n##### Hover preview\n\nWhen hovering over links, their content is displayed within a popup box. This works similarly to the [[Page preview]] plugin in Obsidian.\n\n##### Custom CSS\n\nTo customize the styling of your site, you can upload a `publish.css`. This file must be stored in the root folder of your site. You can use your existing theme and add some extra tweaks for publish in `publish.css`.\n\n##### Favicon\n\nTo change the favicon of your site, you can upload `png` icons of any size in the format of `favicon-32.png` or `favicon-32x32.png`. You can also upload the file `favicon.ico`. These files can be stored in any folder. The current recommendation (as of 2020) is to provide sizes `32×32`, `128x128`, `152×152`, `167x167`, `180x180`, `192x192`, and `196x196`.\n\n##### Custom JS\n\nIf you wish to execute your own JavaScript code to change the visitor experience, or add various integrations like Discus!, Discourse, etc. you can do so by uploading `publish.js` inside the root of your vault. Note that these scripts will only run for visitors to your custom domain.\n\n##### Disallow search engine indexing\n\nThis option adds a meta noindex tag to all your pages so search engines like Google does not index your site. Note that search engines won't be able to index your site anyway if it's password protected.\n\n##### Google Analytics\n\nIf you wish to setup Google Analytics for your site, first make sure your local laws and regulations allows. Then, you just need to put the tracking code, in the form of `UA-XXXXX-Y` into the text box and your site will automatically track page views. Note that Google Analytics is only available to visitors from your custom domain.\n\nWhen testing Google Analytics, please make sure to disable any ad-blocking browser extensions like uBlock Origin which blocks Google Analytics scripts from running.\n\nAlso, Obsidian Publish isn't directly compatible with Google Tag Manager at the moment - you can set it up using custom javascript if you wish to use Google Tag Manager instead of Google Analytics.\n\n### Custom domain\n\nYou can setup a custom domain or subdomain for your Obsidian Publish site. Currently, we don't yet have a way to provision SSL certificate on your behalf, so you need to resort to either an SSL-enabled server of your own, or to setup your site on CloudFlare, which provides SSL for free.\n\nYou can also setup Obsidian Publish as a sub-URL of a site you own. For example, `https://mysite.com/my-notes/`. To achieve this, you must host your own server and proxy all requests to our server at `https://publish.obsidian.md/`.\n\nContinue reading for setup details.\n\n#### CloudFlare setup\n\nThe easiest way to setup a custom domain or subdomain is by making an account with [CloudFlare](https://cloudflare.com) and letting CloudFlare manage your domain. This allows you to add SSL to your site for free, as well as ensure your site is fast wherever in the world it's accessed from. Typically users will host their Obsidian Publish content on a root domain (e.g. `mysite.com`) or an immediate subdomain (e.g. `notes.mysite.com`). These instructions work for both cases.\n\n1. Open Cloudflare to the domain you wish to add Publish to (e.g. `mysite.com`, even if you want a subdomain like `notes.mysite.com`).\n2. Go to DNS and click Add Record. Select CNAME, and in 'name' enter the domain or subdomain you wish (e.g. `notes.mysite.com`). In 'target', enter the value `publish-main.obsidian.md`. Do not include your personal sub-URL in this value, as Obsidian Publish handles this from your configuration. \n3. Go to SSL/TLS and set the SSL/TLS encryption mode to `Full`. This will configure the SSL/TLS certificate automatically.\n\nOnce you are done with configuring CloudFlare, you can head to your site options in Obsidian, and set the URL to your domain or subdomain. This allows our server to associate the domain to your site.\n\nTroubleshooting: If your custom domain setup ends up in a redirect loop, it's likely that the encryption mode in CloudFlare to `Flexible` instead of `Full`.\n\nIf you wish to configure both `mysite.com` and `www.mysite.com` to Obsidian Publish, you will need to create a [Page Rule](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200172336-Creating-Page-Rules) as follows:\n- URL match: `www.mysite.com/*`\n- Foward URL - 301 Permanent Redirect\n- Redirect URL: `https://mysite.com/$1`\n\nOnce you create the page rule, you should also create a CNAME record for `www.mysite.com` just like you created for `mysite.com`\n\n#### Proxy/redirect setup\n\nIf you wish to host your own web server and setup your own SSL encryption, you can choose this option. If you are already hosting a website under your domain or subdomain, you can also use this option and setup your website to load your Obsidian Publish site under a specific URL path, instead of hosting the full site.\n\nSimply proxy all requests under that URL path to `https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/...` and **configure the site options in Obsidian to the same URL path** by setting **Custom URL** to `mysite.com/my-notes`.\n\n##### NGINX\n\n```nginx\nlocation /my-notes {\n  proxy_pass https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/;\n  proxy_ssl_server_name on;\n}\n```\n\n##### Apache\n\nAdd to `.htaccess`:\n\n```htaccess\nRewriteEngine  on\nRewriteRule    \"^my-notes/(.*)$\"  \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/$1\"  [L,P]\n```\n\nNote: mod_rewrite must be enabled, and you may also need to configure [SSLProxyEngine](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40938148/reverse-proxy-for-external-url-apache)\n\n##### Netlify\n\n```\n[[redirects]]\n  from = \"https://mysite.com/my-notes/*\"\n  to = \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/:splat\"\n  status = 200\n  force = true\n```\n\n##### Vercel\n\nIn `vercel.json` [configure rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/configuration#project/rewrites):\n\n```json\n{\n  ...\n\n  \"rewrites\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/my-notes/\",\n      \"destination\": \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/my-notes/:path*\",\n      \"destination\": \"https://publish.obsidian.md/serve?url=mysite.com/my-notes/:path*\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n##### Supported HTTP X-Headers\n\nAlternatively, if your proxy service does not allow query paths, you can use `https://publish.obsidian.md/` with a custom header `x-obsidian-custom-domain` set to your site url `mysite.com/my-subpath`.\n\n#### Custom domain post-setup issues\n\nOnce you setup your custom domain, if you've visited your site from your previous `https://publish.obsidian.md/slug` link, you may have to clear your browser cache for certain things (like fonts, graphs, or password access) to work properly. This is due to the cross-domain security restrictions that are imposed by modern browsers. The good news is that readers of your site should never run into issue this if you only let visitors use your custom domain.\n\n#### Redirect old site to custom domain\n\nIf you'd like to redirect your visitors from the old `publish.obsidian.md` site to your new custom domain, there is an option you can enable in the custom domain settings page which will do just that.\n\n### Coming up\n\nObsidian Publish is still in its early days. Here are some features we plan to add:\n\n- Full custom domain support (with SSL certificate provisioning).\n- Full text search.\n- More built-in themes.\n\nPlease let us know if you have any Obsidian Publish feature requests by submitting a [forum request here](https://forum.obsidian.md/).\n\n### Pricing\n\nFor the pricing of Obsidian Publish, please visit [our pricing page](https://obsidian.md/pricing).\n\n### Technical details\n\nObsidian Publish uses Cloudflare as the CDN (content delivery network) to distribute your site across the globe for a faster access. This involves caching copies of the files of your site on some of the 200+ data centers to ensure the lowest latency for your readers and the site remain speedy and loads fast even if your viewer lives far away from our primary servers.\n\nHowever, this does mean that when you change site settings, publish new content, or unpublish content, visitors might not see the latest version for a short while. Currently, our cache is configured to persist for an hour before it has to be \"re-validated\" to ensure the content hasn't changed.\n\nIf you've just published items but you are still seeing an older version, you can typically perform a \"hard refresh\" by holding the reload button and choosing \"Hard reload\" in the dropdown menu. Failing that, you can try clearing the browser cache or disabling cache using the developer tools in the network tab.\n\n#### Hosting media files\n\nWhile Obsidian Publish allows you to upload video clips, it is not optimized for video delivery. As such, your visitors may find that the videos on your site may not deliver a great experience.\n\nWe recommend using a proper video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo to host your videos for Obsidian Publish. The advantages of using a proper video hosting site includes:\n- Automatic re-encoding ensures that your videos can be played on all mobile devices regardless of what encoding format you used in your original file.\n- Dynamic quality adjustment based on bandwidth availability and ensures that videos can be played smoothly without constantly pausing for \"buffering\".\n- High efficiency video compression to ensure that visitors don't blow through their data cap when viewing your site.\n- Global CDN allowing your videos to be loaded fast regardless of where your visitor is located in the world.\n\n---\n\n### Related\n\nRefer to the [[Publish|Publish plugin]] for details on publishing your notes. \n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Licenses & add-on services/Obsidian Sync/","title":"Obsidian Sync"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Obsidian Sync™ is a paid service to sync notes between vaults on various devices.\n\n### How Obsidian Sync works\n\nObsidian Sync is fairly simple: once you hook up local vaults from multiple devices to the same remote vault, changes will be automatically synced between these local vaults, except for files and folders you instruct Obsidian to ignore.\n\n### Features\n\nCurrently, Obsidian Sync features:\n\n- End-to-end encryption.\n- Version history integrated into Obsidian.\n- View & restore deleted files.\n- Synchronize settings, themes, CSS snippets, plugins, and plugin settings.\n- Selective sync.\n\t- Exclude certain folders.\n\t- Toggle syncing for images, audio, video, PDF, and unsupported files.\n- Switch between multiple remote vaults.\n\nIn the future, we'll improve Obsidian Sync with:\n\n- Vault sharing\n\n\n### Enable Obsidian Sync plugin\n\nYou can enable Obsidian Sync by enabling the \"Sync\" plugin under Settings => Core plugins.\n\n### Setting up remote vaults\n\nWarning: We do not recommend using third party sync services to sync the same vault with Obsidian Sync. [[#Third party sync|More about this later]].\n\nTo start syncing, first you need to create a remote vault that stores your encrypted data.\n\nTo do that, go to Setting => Sync => Pick remote vault => Choose => Create new vault.\n\nAfter creating it, you can immediately connect to the vault by clicking on the \"Connect\" button next to it.\n\nYou can choose to either start syncing immediately after connecting, or choose folders to ignore.\n\n##### Set encryption password \n\nBy default, you need to set an encryption password for your vault. This password is used to encrypt and decrypt your data and is extremely important.\n\nYou'll be asked for the password any time you setup sync with an encrypted vault. ==If you forget or lose the password, your data will remain encrypted and unusable forever. We are unable to recover your password or any encrypted data for you.== Your local files are not affected.\n\nYou can also choose to turn off the \"Custom end-to-end password\" option to leave managing the encryption key to us. This is still fairly secure and provides the convenience of not having to remember a password.\n\n### Check sync status\n\nAfter connecting to a remote vault, you can check the current sync status in the bottom status bar. You can hover over the status icon to read more about what's going on.\n\nClicking on the status icon will open up sync settings as a shortcut.\n\n### Version history\n\nAs you edit your notes, versions are saved approximately every 10 seconds. ==Version history is only available for notes, not attachments.==\n\nYou can right click a file in the file explorer pane to see its version history. This option is also available in the more options menu.\n\nAfter selecting a version in the left column in the version history screen, you can restore the file to this version by clicking on the \"Restore\" button.\n\n### Deleted files\n\nAfter you delete a file, you can view it in Setting => Sync => Deleted files => View.\n\nClicking on a deleted file will open its version history. You can then choose to restore the file back to a previous version.\n\n### Selective sync\n\nYou can selectively sync files by folder or file type. ==Selective sync only applies to future changes. Any files that have already been uploaded will not be deleted even if you choose to ignore them. Please be sure to configure it before starting the sync process.==\n\n##### Exclude folders\n\nYou can uncheck folders in Settings => Sync => Excluded folders => Manage to prevent them from getting synced.\n\nExcluded folders will be ignored when both uploading and download changes.\n\n#### File types\n\nYou can toggle sync for images, audio, video, PDFs, and unsupported files under Settings => Sync => Selective sync.\n\n### Synchronizing settings\n\nIn addition to your notes and attachments, Obsidian Sync offers individual toggles to synchronize these files:\n- The main app settings, including editor settings, files & links settings, etc.\n- Appearance settings, including dark mode, selected theme, and enabled snippets.\n- Themes and snippets that has been downloaded.\n- Hotkeys.\n- Which core plugins are enabled.\n- Core plugin settings.\n- Which community plugins are enabled.\n- Downloaded/installed community plugins, and their settings.\n\nYou can choose which ones to synchronize with your remote vault to best suite your use case of Obsidian.\n\nKeep in mind that Obsidian does not apply your settings until you restart the application, or reload the vault. This normally isn't a problem on mobile since the app restarts often, but you may notice that settings you set on one desktop device is \"synced\" to another device, but doesn't take effect until the next restart.\n\nSync will respect your selection of the settings folder override in case you've set it to a folder other than `.obsidian`. You can take advantage of this to create different profiles in your remote vault to sync your settings. A common use case, for example, is to use a different profile for mobile devices vs desktop devices.\n\n#### Settings version history\n\nIf something goes wrong, and you lost some of your settings, you can always revert the affected settings file through the \"Settings version history\" section in Sync.\n\n### Third party sync\n\nIf you are using Obsidian Sync, we do not recommend using third party sync services like Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or iCloud to sync the same vault between the same devices using Obsidian Sync. Doing so may cause conflicts, duplicate files, or in the worst case, could lead to corrupted files.\n\nIf you do setup Obsidian Sync and a third party sync service to sync a vault between two devices, then the following will happen:\n- If Obsidian Sync \"wins\" the race and syncs your file first, then your third party sync service will generate a \"conflicted copy\".\n- If your third party sync service \"wins\" the race and syncs your file first, then Obsidian Sync will attempt to merge the two slightly different versions, often causing the last few characters you just typed to be rolled back.\n\nIf you wish to maintain a backup of your vault using a third party sync service, you can still do so by setting up your sync provider on your primary single device, but not on your secondary devices. This will ensure that your third party sync service does not \"race\" with Obsidian Sync.\n\n### FAQ\n\n##### What is end-to-end encryption?\n\nEnd-to-end encryption means the data is encrypted from the moment it leaves your device, and can only be decrypted using your encryption key once it's back on one of your devices.\n\nWe do not have the capability of reading your data, nor do any potential eavesdroppers, such as your internet service provider.\n\nIn the rare case of a complete server breach, your data will remain encrypted, and nobody will have the ability to decrypt your files without knowing your password.\n\n##### How many remote vaults can I have?\n\nEach account with Obsidian Sync can have up to 5 remote vaults.\n\n##### How long is version history kept?\n\nVersion histories are kept for up to one year before we clean it up.\n\n##### How large can each remote vault be?\n\nAt the moment, each remote vault can have up to 4 GB of data, including version history.\n\n##### Is my data encrypted on my hard disk?\n\nNo, your data is still in plain text on your hard disk. If you wish to encrypt it from people who use your computer, you should look for a disk encryption solution.\n\n##### How long is my data kept after my subscription expires?\n\nData in your remote vaults, including version history, is kept for one month for you, after your subscription expires.\n\nAs long as you renew within one month, there should be no impact on your usage.\n\n##### Can I use Obsidian Sync as a backup solution?\n\nObsidian Sync is designed as a data synchronization service, rather than a backup service.\n\nWith version history, it does provide some backup features, however we still recommend having additional backup measures.\n\nObsidian Sync is currently in beta testing, so we strongly recommend having backups, in case of software bugs and glitches.\n\n##### Should I pick my own encryption password?\n\nPick your password if you require the highest level of security and privacy. This guarantees that anyone who doesn't know your password will never be able to read your notes.\n\nLetting us manage your encryption key is more convenient, and you do not risk forgetting or losing your password.\n\nYour local vault is not affected by this option. If you properly backup your local vault, this may not be a problem for you.\n\n##### Is the end-to-end encryption strong?\n\nWe use industry-standard AES-256 to encrypt your data. AES-256 is a military-grade encryption specification that is widely used in online banking.\n\nHere are the technical details for those interested:\n\n- Key derivation function used: scrypt with salt\n- Encryption algorithm used: AES-256 using GCM\n\n##### What does the `vault limit exceeded` error mean?\n\nEach vault using Obsidian Sync has a maximum size of 4gb. This error indicates your vault has exceeded that limit in size. Don't forget: attachments and version history contributes to the maximum, so you may exceed your 4gb limit even if your vault's actual size is less than 4gb. \n\nIf you see this error, Obsidian can help you identify and purge large files from the Vault. Go to the Obsidian Sync settings in Preferences => Sync and look for the \"Vault size over limit\" options. \n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Licenses & add-on services/Obsidian Unlimited/","title":"Obsidian Unlimited"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Obsidian Unlimited is a way to contribute a custom amount to Obsidian develop as you wish.

The public `Documents` folder is typically stored in SD card or emulated storage.\n\nAny folder in this home folder will be considered a vault. If you sync or copy a vault folder into this directory, it can be recognized when you open Obsidian.\n\n## Sync\n\nOn Android, you may choose to use [[Obsidian Sync]] to synchronize your files, or use any third party sync provider that can perform sync in the background.\n\n### Obsidian Sync\n\nAs with Obsidian desktop, we provide our built-in paid [[Obsidian Sync]] service.\n\nTo setup a synced vault through Obsidian Sync, first create a new empty local vault. You should name it the same as your desktop app to make [[Using obsidian URI|inter-vault URIs]] work.\n\nOnce the empty vault is open, open the left sidebar, tap the settings button, and setup Obsidian Sync just like you did on Desktop:\n\n1. Login to your Obsidian account in the Account tab.\n2. Enable the Sync core plugin.\n3. Open settings, and choose the \"Sync\" tab under \"Plugin options\".\n4. Choose the remote vault to sync with.\n5. Keep the app open until all your files have synced over.\n\nTo view the sync status of Obsidian Sync, swipe to pull out the right drawer, and you should see the status indicator just like it shows on the desktop app. Tap on it to get more information, such as viewing the sync log to debug any issues.\n\n### Third party sync\n\nYou can also use your preferred sync solution to keep the local folder on your phone in sync with other devices.\n\nThere are apps on the Play Store that let you sync a folder on your phone with other devices, for example [Dropsync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.dropsync) or [FolderSync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=dk.tacit.android.foldersync.lite).\n\n## Storage Permission\n\nWhen starting Obsidian, you may notice that it prompts for permission to access your device's documents and media.\n\nIn an ideal world, we'd prefer to only ask for access rights to the vault folders you choose. However, Android's privacy-friendly file permission API (also known as \"scoped storage\") has a few restrictions that makes it impossible for Obsidian to function properly.\n\nThe two biggest roadblocks are:\n- Scoped storage performs many extra permission checks for every single file access, causing significant performance degradation when opening and using Obsidian.\n- Scoped storage does not provide a way to watch for external changes, which is critical when using Obsidian with a third-party synchronization tool.\n\nGoogle specifically gives instructions for developers of this kind of apps a special permission. Obsidian belongs to two categories in the list of exceptions: \"document management apps\", and \"on-device file search\".

But its true power lies in managing densely networked knowledge base.\n\nHow do we start creating a network, you ask? Let's first start making some [[Internal link|internal links]]!\n\n## How we're different\n\n==*We want you to own and control your data*==\n\nWe believe in plain text for something as important as your knowledge base. You don't want to put your own brain over someone else's neck, do you? Treat your second brain the same way.\n\nSync is only a utility to facilitate working on multiple devices, the data will always primarily live on your hard disk.\n\nWhen the file system replaces the cloud, you get flexible options to work with your files: you can back them up with Dropbox, use Git to do versioning, or encrypt your disk for security. Whatever works on your file system will work on your Obsidian knowledge base.\n\n==*Links are first-class citizens*==\n\nLinks and connections are crucial to discovering the relations between what we know.\n\nObsidian greatly values this, and encourages it with [[Internal link]] and [[Graph view]], among other things.\n\nAs John Locke puts it...\n\n> The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three:\n> 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made.\n> 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations.\n> 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.\n\n \\- John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)\n \nHierarchy gives us No. 1, and linking gives us No. 2. We're still unsure what No. 3 entails in the context of note-taking, but it might have something to do with programming or macros.\n\n==*Your own toolkit*==\n\nNote-taking is a highly personal activity. Naturally there is no single all-encompassing solution for everyone.\n\nInstead of providing you with an opinionated and assembled product, [[Obsidian]] gives you a foundation and numerous functional building blocks  to discover and build your own solution.\n\nThe foundation is to be able to view files, edit them, and search them. For the minimalist, that's enough.\n\nOn top of that, you can add isolated, independent building blocks to add features to your note-taking:\n\n- If you're taking class notes, [[Audio recorder]] and LaTeX math might be useful;\n\n- If you're taking work notes, [[Slides]] and [[Backlinks]] may come in handy;\n\n- If you're a researcher, [[Graph view]] and [[Word count]] might be essential to your toolkit.\n\nWe don't expect plugins to be the silver bullet to solve all the problems, but it does get us closer than a monolith solution, without all the features that you don't need cluttering the interface.\n\nWe support [[Customizing CSS|custom CSS]] and have a [[Third-party plugins|beta plugin API]], which will enable even more interface customization and support less common use cases.\n\n## Follow our development\n\nObsidian is in public beta right now. We have [a roadmap](https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap) that you can check out.\n\nOur Twitter handle is [@obsdmd](https://twitter.com/obsdmd), feel free to follow. We mostly tweet about product updates.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Obsidian/iOS app/","title":"iOS App"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The iOS app is now publicly available, and a link to the app store listing can be found at https://obsidian.md/mobile\n\n## Where are my vaults stored?\n\nIf you choose, you can store your vaults in iCloud Drive. These vaults can be found in your iCloud Drive folder, under an app folder named \"Obsidian\" that shows the Obsidian logo.\n\nIf you choose not to use iCloud for a vault, then it will be stored in the sandboxed file system of the Obsidian app. The local vaults are accessible from any other apps that support picking a folder from the file system. As such, apps like Working Copy can be used to sync with Obsidian's local vaults.\n\n==Be aware that if you choose to store your vault locally, they will be automatically deleted by iOS when you uninstall Obsidian's app.==\n\n## Sync\n\n### Quick start\n\nIf you already have a vault on your desktop, here's the two ways to sync your vault to mobile and access it:\n\n- [[#iCloud Drive Sync]]\n- [[#Obsidian Sync]]\n\nThe two current officially supported sync solutions are iCloud and Obsidian Sync.\nWorking Copy (git) is another alternative that has been tested to work with Obsidian on iOS.\n\nCurrently, there is **no** known support for the following sync services on iOS yet:\n- Dropbox\n- Google Drive\n- OneDrive\n- Syncthing\n\nIf you find out a way to sync using these services on iOS with Obsidian, we would be glad if you can join our Discord server and teach us how to set it up.\n\nIn theory, any third party sync providers that can provide background-sync for a specific folder on your device should be able to work, but we are not aware of any other than Working Copy. This is due to the limitations of the highly complex mechanism of cross-app file sharing in iOS, unlike Android which allows easy cross-app file sharing. Because of this, most third party sync providers don't have a proper implementation for background sync on iOS.\n\nCurrently Obsidian does not support third party sync providers that expose a virtual file system through FileProvider. We will be attempting this in the future as an improvement.\n\n### Obsidian Sync\n\nYou can follow the same steps as Android's sync as shown below, making sure that you create a non-iCloud folder as we do not recommend using both Obsidian Sync and iCloud Sync concurrently, which has been reported to cause data loss due to [[Obsidian Sync#Third party sync|race conditions]].\n\n![[Android app#Obsidian Sync]]\n\n### iCloud Drive Sync\n\nTo setup a **new** synced vault through iCloud Drive:\n\n1. Start the iOS app and choose \"Create a new vault\";\n2. On desktop, using the \"Open another vault\" option, point to the new vault location in iCloud.\n\nTo setup an **existing** vault to be synced through iCloud Drive:\n\n1. Start the app and choose \"Create a new vault\";\n2. Name it the same as your desktop vault to make [[Using obsidian URI|inter-vault URIs]] work;\n3. Wait for iCloud to sync this empty folder to your desktop;\n4. Copy and paste everything under your vault to this empty folder, this will now be your synced folder location;\n5. On desktop, using the \"Open another vault\" option, point to the new vault location in iCloud;\n6. Wait for iCloud to sync everything to your mobile device.\n\n### Working Copy\n\nYou can alternatively setup Working Copy to use Git to sync your vault on iOS. To do this, you should create an empty local vault on your device first, then you can \"Setup Folder Sync\" and select a local vault inside the Obsidian app. Then, you can manually commit & push.\n\n### Third party sync support\n\nMany users asks why Obsidian for Mobile doesn't support their preferred sync solution. Here's a brief explanation on the current state of mobile sync support.\n\nThe thing about Obsidian that's different from other apps like 1Writer and iA Writer is that Obsidian works on top of a vault rather than a single note. Many of the core Obsidian functionality depend on the whole vault and all the files inside, such as the link auto-complete, image embedding, tag pane, backlinks, and all the cross-note functionality.\n\nIn contrast, most Markdown editing apps simply \"open\" a single note, let the user perform edits, then save the note back. Because of this, the OS and third party sync providers typically only provide an API for accessing/working with a single file, but not so much for working with a vault (folder of files with potentially subfolders).\n\nFor sync, a regular markdown editor app can simply implement the basic \"download file when you open a selected file\" and \"upload the file back when you press save\". Obsidian has to download the whole vault to be useful, and keep track of all the modified files (like for example, when you perform a file rename, we might update a bunch of other files for links that has changed due to the rename). On top of that, we need a way to monitor for changes through the sync solution to be able to update our internal caches when files change, to provide accurate links.\n\nKeeping all that in sync with a third party sync provider would be quite tedious - and this is actually part of the reason why most sync providers don't make a proper sync client for mobile and you have to use a third party app (like DropSync or FolderSync) to do it. Unfortunately, such apps don't exist on iOS because of app sandboxing.\n\n## Known issues\n\n### iCloud folder on macOS\n\nIf you find yourself unable to drag & drop things into the iCloud folder in Finder on macOS, please download the latest Obsidian Desktop release from https://obsidian.md as it contains a fix for this issue. Once it's installed, running the app should automatically cause iCloud to update the folder permissions. If this does not work right away, you may need to restart your machine.\n\n### Paste menu sometimes not appearing\n\nSome users runs into an issue where tapping on the cursor does not show the paste menu. As a workaround, you can use the three-finger tap gesture to trigger a global edit menu which can be used to paste into the text.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Panes/Linked pane/","title":"Linked Pane"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"Panes can be linked together. This has two main effects:\n\n- By default, when opening a new [[Preview and edit modes|preview pane]] from an editing pane, the new pane is linked to the old one. This means that any changes you make in the editor will show up in the preview in real time. It also means that scrolling one will scroll the other.\n\n- When a new [[Working with backlinks|Backlink Pane]] is created from a note, it will be linked to that note. This means that backlinks will always be shown for the note that is in that pane. This is useful if you want to reference a set of backlinks but let the regular backlink panel change with whatever other note you are working on.\n\nLinked panes will be marked with a link icon. You can hover the link to see which pane it's linked to, or click the icon to release it, so that they are no longer linked. This will not close the previously-linked pane.\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Panes/Pane layout/","title":"Pane Layout"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"One of the things that makes Obsidian different from other note-taking apps is how easy it is to open multiple files in your preferred configuration.\n\nThe window a file gets opened in is what we call a \"pane\". You can have as many panes as you like.\n\n### Open new panes\n\n#### Open links\n\nIn general, you can click a link to a file while holding Ctrl (on Windows and Linux) or Cmd (on macOS) to open it in a new pane. This includes clicking on files in [[File explorer]], [[Search]] results, [[Backlinks]], [[Graph view]], etc.\n\nThe only notable exception is in the editor. Because in the editor, a single click edits the link text rather than following it, `Ctrl/Cmd-Click` is used to follow the link. Therefore, you'll need to hold Shift in addition to Ctrl/Cmd in order to open the link in a new pane.\n\n#### Split current pane\n\nYou can also use the \"More options\" menu option of a pane to select \"Split vertically\" or \"Split horizontally\" to open two copies of that file.\n\n#### Open linked views\n\nSome options in the \"More options\" menu will also open a new pane that's linked to the current pane, such as \"Open backlinks\" and \"Open local graph\".\n\n### Rearrange panes\n\nTo move a pane, simply drag the pane icon in the top left corner of the pane. As you drag it around, a visual indicator will appear to show where the pane will be placed. Dropping onto each of the four sides of an existing pane creates a horizontal or vertical split, and dropping in the center swaps positions with the target pane. \n\nYou can also drag panes into the two sidebars. Panes in the sidebar work a bit differently, for more please see the [[Pane layout#Panes in the sidebar]] section below.\n\n### Panes in the sidebar\n\nThere are some differences with panes that live in the sidebars.\n\n#### Sidebar panes can share space with tabs\n\nWhen your drop a pane onto a sidebar pane, a new tab will be created under that sidebar section. Different panes in the same sidebar section can be accessed by clicking on its tab icon.\n\n#### Sidebar panes do not show titles\n\nThis reduces clutter, but also means it's best to keep one or two important files like a scratch pad or the daily note for quick access, rather than having a dozen files open.\n\nTo see the title of a file that's in the sidebar, hover over its tab icon.\n\n#### Sidebar can be easily collapsed\n\nIf there are panes that you only need to look at from time to time, having them in the sidebar makes it really easy to toggle them with a hotkey or command.\n\n#### Toggle editor and preview in sidebar\n\nThe hotkey to toggle between editor and preview only works in the main workspace. In the sidebar, you'll need to right click on the tab icon and select \"Preview\" or \"Edit\" to toggle between two modes.\n\n### Save and load pane layouts\n\nThe [[Workspaces]] plugin makes it easy to come back to a particular pane layout.

Once published, your site will be available at `https://publish.obisidian.md/{site-id}`.\n\nAfter creating a unique site ID, you'll have the option to give your site a name, select a home page, set a theme, and toggle various components such as graph view, table of contents, etc. You can toggle these options by clicking on the gear icon near your site name at the top of the Publish plugin.\n\n### Select files for publishing\n\nAfter setting up your site, you can now publish your notes!\n\nWith a fresh, empty site, all your notes will appear under the \"New\" section, meaning they are new to your site.

(You can read more about YAML in Obsidian [[YAML front matter|here]].)\n\nIf you set `publish: true`, then new files will be automatically selected the next time you publish changes.\n\nIf you set `publish: false`, then the file will not be visble when publishing changes, and will not show up in new/changed files. If this file had been previously published, you will see an option to delete it instead.\n\nIf you do not use YAML to flag publish files, the default behaviour is to automatically select changed files, but not new files.\n\n### Make changes\n\nAs you make changes to notes that have already been published, those changes will be automatically selected when you open the Publish plugin dialog. You may uncheck any files you wish not to publish to your site.\n\n### Change site options\n\nYou can change various site options by clicking on the gear icon near your site name when in the \"Publish changes\" dialogue.\n\n#### Metadata\n\nIn this section, you can set site name, home page file (the file visitors see when they land on your site), and manage custom domain (please see [[Obsidian Publish#Custom domain|this guide]] to set up your custom domain).\n\n#### Appearance\n\nHere you can change the theme between light and dark.\n\nIf you want more customization, you can look into setting up [[Obsidian Publish#Custom CSS|custom CSS]] and [[Obsidian Publish#Favicon|favicon]].\n\n#### Reading experience\n\nIn this section, you can:\n\n- Enable a special mode called \"sliding windows\" that looks like [Andy Matuschak's notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/);\n- Enable page preview on hover like when using [[Page preview]] plugin in the app;\n- Configure whether you want readable line length and strict line breaks.\n\n#### Components\n\nYour site comes with a few components that you can toggle on or off. These include:\n\n- File explorer (default on)\n- Local graph (default on)\n- Outline (default off)\n- Backlink at the bottom (default off)\n- Search bar (default off, requires file explorer)\n\n#### Security\n\nHere you can set passwords to protect your site. Once set, all visitors need to enter one of the passwords to enter your site.\n\nMultiple passwords facilitate sharing with multiple groups. When you no longer wish to share with one group of visitors, you can simply delete that password. Each password can be named for your convenience as well.\n\nAs of 2021/01/20, all notes on your site are protected by the same set of passwords.\n\n### Add linked notes\n\nThe \"Add linked\" button allows you to include for publishing any notes in your vault that are referenced (linked to) by any currently selected notes. This is a good way to ensure there are no dead links on your published site.\n\nBy way of example, let's assume you select Note A for publishing. Supposing Note A has links to Note P, Note Q, and Note R, then if you click the \"Add linked\" button, Notes P, Q, and R will all be selected for publishing along with the currently selected Note A.\n\nEach time you click the \"Add linked\" button, the Publish plugin will look for links within every currently selected file to include for publication. Please be sure you review the list of selected files before clicking the \"Publish\" button.\n\n### Delete published notes\n\nYou always have the option of removing any notes that have been published to your site. Within the Publish plugin, all published notes will be listed, of which any/all can be selected for removal. Deleting a note from your site **does not** remove the note from your vault, thus giving you the option to re-publish the note again in the future.\n\n### Delete entire site\n\nIf you'd like to delete an entire site, click the switch-site (arrows) icon near the top of the Publish plugin. Then click the X button to delete your site. Note: this only removes your public site but does not affect any files in your vault.

In most cases, if you just type what you want to find, it will work. But search has many capabilities for narrowing down to find exactly what you want.\n\n## Quick tips\n\n### Start searching\n\nYou can invoke search by pressing `Ctrl-Shift-F` or `Cmd-Shift-F`. You can also customize this hotkey in Settings => Hotkeys. When search is invoked, focus will be automatically put in the search bar so you can start typing your query right away.\n\n### Search selected text\n\nAfter you select text, you can search for it by simply invoking search like above.\n\n## Search history\n\nObsidian will remember your most recently used search queries.\n\nThese queries will be presented to you when your search query is empty. You can click on any one of them to search for it again, allowing you to easily re-run previous queries.\n\nTo clear search history, simply click on the \"X\" button.\n\n## Search Settings\n\nThere are a couple of toggles available while searching:\n\n- `Match case` toggle case sensitive matching, but note that it can be overridden on a per-search basis using the `match-case:` and `ignore-case:` operators explained above.\n- `Explain search term` will show you what the search query actually does in plain terms.\n- `Collapse results` will toggle between just showing matching note names and showing the lines in which matches appear. These extended results can be toggled for each note by clicking on the folding triangle next to the file name.\n- `Show more context` will expand the display of the matches to show more text around the match.\n- `Change sort order` sorts the results by various orders, similar to how files are sorted in the [[File explorer]].\n\n## Copy search results\n\nTo quickly and easily take your search results to a list, use the \"copy search result\" option.\n\nYou can customize whether you want to show paths, which link style to use (wikilink or Markdown link), and how you want your list to appear.\n\n## Embed search results\n\nYou can embed search results in a note.\n\nFor example, if you write:\n\n```query\nembed OR search\n```\n\nYou should see this embedded search view (note: it doesn't work on [[Obsidian Publish]] as of 2020/01/18):\n\n```query\nembed OR search\n```\n\n## Search syntax\n\n### Combining sub-queries\n\nWhen crafting a search query, remember that clicking \"Explain Search Term\" will give an explanation of what is being searched for, which can be very useful when debugging a complicated search.\n\n- Words in the search query separated by space will be searched independently in each note. For example `foo bar` will find a note that includes both `foo` and `bar` anywhere in it.\n- `\"Quoted strings\"` can be used to search multiple consecutive words separated by space, or in other words, a phrase. So, searching for `\"foo bar\"` with quotes will only find notes that include those words next to each other. You can use backslash `\\\"` to escape double quotes if you actually want to search for a string that includes quotes. And `\\\\` will do the same for backslash.\n- Boolean operations can be used. Use `OR` to match one or another. Use `-` to negate a query. The space character is used for boolean \"and\".\n  - For example: `foo OR bar` will find all notes that contain either of those words, they don't have to be in the same note. `foo -bar` will find all notes that contain `foo`, but not if they also contain `bar`.\n- Parenthesis can be used to group boolean operations. For example `((a OR b) (c OR d))`. This can be useful when crafting complex searches to make sure things happen in the order you want.\n- Regular expressions (regex) can now be used in search. Use forward slash to denote a regular expression. For example: `/[a-z]{3}/`. Obsidian accepts the JavaScript flavor regular expressions. You can learn more about it [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).\n\n### Search operators\n\nSeveral special operators are available. Some operators allow nesting queries using parenthesis, for example: `file:(\"to be\" OR -\"2B\")`. You can use `-` to exclude specific results from search, for example: `foo -tag:#bar`.\n\n- `file:(...)` will perform the following subquery on the file name. For example: `file:.jpg`. If you use Zettelkasten-style UIDs, this can be useful for narrowing a time range, for example `file:202007`for files created in July of 2020.\n- `path:(...)` will perform the following subquery on the file path, absolute from the root. For example: `path:\"Daily Notes/2020-07\"`.\n- `content:(...)` will perform the following subquery on the file content. For example: `content:\"happy cat\"`.\n- `match-case:(...)` and `ignore-case(...):` will override the case sensitive match logic for the following subquery.\n- `tag:` will search for your specified tag within a file, for example `tag:#work`. This is faster and more accurate than searching for the tag in plaintext `#work`, as it uses the cached information and ignores text in code blocks and sections that aren't markdown text.\n- `line:(...)` will perform the subquery on a line-by-line basis, rather than a file-by-file basis. For example, if you search for `foo bar`, this could match a file that has `foo` in the first paragraph and `bar` in the last paragraph. Searching for `line:(foo bar)` will only match if `foo` and `bar` are on the same line.\n- `block:(...)` will perform the subquery on a block-by-block basis, where each block defined as a markdown block, typically separated by empty lines or list items. This is expensive computationally as it requires parsing each file, which means this is likely slower than other modes.\n- `section:(...)` will perform the subquery on a section-by-section basis, where each section is the text between two headings, including the first heading.\n- `task:(...)` will perform the subquery only on each [[Format your notes#Task list|task]] and on a block-by-block basis. Use `task:\"\"` to match all tasks.\n- `task-todo:(...)` will perform the subquery only on each _uncompleted_ [[Format your notes#Task list|task]] and on a block-by-block basis. Use `task-todo:\"\"` to match all uncompleted tasks.\n- `task-done:(...)` will perform the subquery only on each _completed_ [[Format your notes#Task list|task]] and on a block-by-block basis.

You can change the sort order to alphabetical or reverse it.\n\n### Nested tags\n\nIf you write your tags like `#inbox/to-read` and `#inbox/processing`, you can enable \"show nested tags\" to view them as a tree instead of a flat list.\n\nUnder the default flat view, the tag pane will look like:\n\n```\n- inbox/to-read\n- inbox/processing\n```\n\nUnder the nested tag view, the tag pane will look like:\n\n```\n- inbox\n\t- to-read\n\t- processing\n```\n\n"},{"fields":{"slug":"/Plugins/Templates/","title":"Templates"},"frontmatter":{"draft":false},"rawBody":"The Templates plugin lets you quickly insert snippets of text into your current note.\n\n### Set up template folder\n\nEach template snippet is just a normal Markdown note, like everything else in Obsidian.\n\nTo designate template files, put them into a folder, and choose that folder in Settings => Templates => \"Template folder location\" after enabling the plugin\n\n### Insert a template\n\nAfter setting up the folder location, using the ribbon icon to insert the template.
